Core Data is one of the most commonly used method for storing data in your iOS applications. The process of saving data for later usage is often referred to as Caching. Benefits you get from implementing Caching in your apps include offline usage, lightning fast display of data without server fetching, organized data structures for optimized code, etc. 

Core Data utilizes SQLite to store data inside your app. If you're familiar with how relational databases work, you'll understand how quickly Reads, Writes, Updates, and Deletes are processed using this library.
